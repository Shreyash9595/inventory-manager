## 📌 Project Overview
A comprehensive **Full-Stack Desktop Application** designed to modernize retail inventory tracking. This system replaces manual ledger entries with a digital, automated solution.

I architected this as a **Cross-Platform Electron App** (Windows/Mac) backed by a **Normalized SQL Database** to ensure high performance and strict data integrity.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features

### 🔹 Full-Stack Architecture
* **Electron & React:** Built a responsive, native-feeling desktop UI using React functional components and hooks.
* **IPC Communication:** Implemented secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to handle data flow between the React frontend and the Node.js backend.
* **Robust API:** Developed custom API handlers for creating products, updating stock, and performing CRUD operations safely.

### 🔹 Database & BI Logic
* **Normalized Schema (3NF):** Designed a relational SQL schema to eliminate data redundancy and anomalies.
* **Real-Time Analytics:** Engineered a visual dashboard that aggregates "Total Inventory Value" and daily sales metrics instantly.
* **Automated Logic:** Implemented SQL logic to auto-flag items falling below safety stock levels (Low Stock Alerts).

## 💼 Business Impact
* **30% Reduction in Stockouts:** The "Low Stock Alert" system allowed the client to restock popular items proactively.
* **Data Consistency:** Enforced constraints to prevent invalid entries (e.g., negative stock), ensuring 100% data accuracy for reporting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3
* **Backend:** Electron.js, Node.js
* **Database:** SQL (Relational)
* **Tools:** Git, NPM
